## Physiological response of *O. patagonica* to the transplantation across depths

### Temperature and PAR across depths

The daily min and max temperature and the daily max PAR were recorded at each depth (10, 25, 45 m) using HOBO and PAR logger and
[visualized](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Ranalysis/output/combined_loggers.jpg). 
Temperature data is available for 3 months (end of June'24 - end of September'24), while PAR data is available for one month (end of June - end of July).  

### Growth rate, total protein, algae cell count and chlorophyll per ug algae

The change of physiological parameters across different transplantation depths (10, 25, 45 m) was assessed with ANOVA/Kruskal–Wallis test depending on the parameter
and visualized with [box plots](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Ranalysis/output/boxplots_combined.jpg).
Significant group differences are indicated with compact letter displays from post-hoc tests.

Since three colonies did not survive transplantation to 25 m, sample sizes were limited (6-3-6 samples, and 6-2-5 for growth rate). 
A significant difference was detected in protein concentration among depths (ANOVA, F = 4.57, p = 0.03), driven by higher values at 10 m compared to 45 m.
For other parameters, ANOVA/Kruskal–Wallis and post-hoc Tukey/Dunn tests did not detect significant differences among depths, likely due to small and unbalanced sample sizes.

Although formal statistical tests of other parameters were inconclusive, we also visually [inspected](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Ranalysis/output/boxplots_combined.jpg)
the data and [estimated](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Ranalysis/output/hedges_combined.jpg) effect sizes (Hedges’ g, a correction of Cohen's d for small sample sizes)
with confidence intervals. Effect size estimates indicated high differences in symbiont cell count (Hedges’ g = 1.26, 95% CI: [-0.35, 2.87) and chlorophyll per ul algae (Hedges' g
= -1.34, 95% CI: [-2.97, 0.28]) between 10m and 25 m, suggesting biologically relevant variation that may not have reached statistical significance because of low statistical power. 

### Photophysiology ###

Photophysiology data was available for initial 4m corals (depth 4), corals, translocated to 10m (depth 10) and 25m (depth 25), as well as to the end-point control at 10m (depth 10_October). The change of photophysiological parameters across different depths was assessed with Kruskal–Wallis test and visualized with
[box plots](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Ranalysis/output/boxplots_fire_combined.jpg).
Significant group differences are indicated with compact letter displays from Dunn post-hoc test with bonferroni correction. 

A significant difference was detected in maximum photosynthetic rate among depths (Kruscal-Wallis, H = 17.804, p = 0.0005), 
driven by higher values at 10 m compared to start-point 4m and end-point 4m, as well as in photosynthetic efficiency (Kruscal-Wallis, H = 12.507, p = 0.006), driven 
by higher values at 25m compared to 10m.
