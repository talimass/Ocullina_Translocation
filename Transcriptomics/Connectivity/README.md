## Fixation index (Fst) estimation by RNA-seq SNPs analysis of _O. patagonica_ samples 
Bash scripts are based on the pipeline for SNP analysis of [Coral_Stress_Phenome](https://github.com/hputnam/Coral_Stress_Phenome/tree/main/Genotype_Analysis/Pocillopora_acuta_PacBio_Assembly/RNAseq_short_variant_analysis) project and on the work of [Federica Scucchia](https://github.com/fscucchia/Pastreoides_development_depth/tree/main/SNPs), with modifications.

### Programs
GATK4 pipeline was installed on the remote cluster through conda using this [guide](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035889851--How-to-Install-and-use-Conda-for-GATK4). PLINK2 and bcftools were also installed via conda. rgsam was installed through [github](https://github.com/djhshih/rgsam), and then the Makefile was manually changed to ensure installation to the local home bin folder.

### Prepare BAM files: Convert reads to BAM, add read group info, merge alignments, filter 
[Fastqtobam.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/fastqtobam.sh) script converts paired fastq files to BAM files sorted by read name, [rgsam.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/rgsam.sh) adds read group info (RG) to aligned reads, [dictreference.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/dictreference.sh) indexes and creates a dictionary from the reference, [mergebam.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/mergebam.sh) merges unaligned BAM files with aligned BAMs and additionally filters the alinged read (e.g. removes secondary alignments). 

### Mark duplicates
[markdup.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/markdup.sh) marks potential PCR duplicates.

### Split reads that contain Ns in their CIGAR string 
[splitsigar.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/splitsigar.sh) splits reads with N in CIGAR - used for post-processing of the alignment.

### Call SNPs and indels
[haplotcall.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/haplotcall.sh) calls variants (SNPs and indels) simultaneously via local de-novo assembly of haplotypes in an active region. 

### Combine *.g.vcf.gz files and call genotypes
[combinegvcf.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/combinegvcf.sh) combines all gvcf files to a cohort file, [genotypegvcf.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/genotypegvcf.sh) performs joint genotyping on a cohort. 

### Filter SNPs and indels
[filtvar1.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/filtvar1.sh) selects SNPs and indels and extracts variant quality scores for making diagnostics plots with [diagnostics.R](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/diagnostics.R).
[filtvar2.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/filtvar2.sh)  performs 1st-pass filtering of variants with the parameters chosen according to the diagnostics plots.
[filtvar3.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/filtvar3.sh)  performs 2nd and 3rd-pass filtering with the parameters chosen according to the diagnostics plots drawn by [plot.dp.scores.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/plot.dp.scores.sh) script.   

Number of variants passed:
```
# Check the number of PASSED after the first filtering
zcat "${OUT}.SNPs.vcf.gz" | grep -v '^#' | wc -l
# 1477466
zcat "${OUT}_SNPs_VarScores_filter.qd.vcf.gz" | grep 'PASS' | wc -l
# 1078283
zcat "${OUT}.INDELs.vcf.gz" | grep -v '^#' | wc -l
# 123034
zcat "${OUT}_INDELs_VarScores_filter.qd.vcf.gz" | grep 'PASS' | wc -l
# 91994
```
```
# Check number of non-missing genotype DP entries after 2nd-pass filtering
for F in *.GT.DP.txt; do awk 'NR>1' $F; done | wc -l
# 26999368
awk 'NR>1' "${OUT}_SNPs_VarScores_filterPASSED_DPfilterNoCall.GT.DP.txt" | wc -l
# 4462395
awk 'NR>1' "${OUT}_INDELs_VarScores_filterPASSED_DPfilterNoCall.GT.DP.txt" | wc -l
# 445852
```
### Filter for linkage disequilibrium
[bcfplink.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/bcfplink.sh) performs pruning of SNPs that are strongly genetically linked and extracts these SNPs from the vcf file.

```
# Variants after pruning
1078283 variants loaded from Ocupat_vcf_pruned-temporary.pvar.
Note: No phenotype data present.
--extract: 92931 variants remaining.
92931 variants remaining after main filters.
```
### Filter for missing data and clonality and QC
[plink.qc.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/plink.qc.sh) calculates per-individual and per-SNP missingness statistics and estimates pairwise kinship coefficients using the KING algorithm.

### Kinship analysis and visualization
[kinship.R](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/kinship.R) visualises the relatedness among samples.

### Collapse artificial clones
[plink.filter.0.3.sh](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/plink.filter.0.3.sh) takes the [list](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/keep.txt) of samples where artificially produced clonal samples (i.e. known fragments of the same colony, since 10m and 25m are pieces of the same corals from the original 5m depth) are collapsed. For each genet, the sample with the lowest missingness score is retained. SNPs were additionally filered for MAF (0.05) and missingness (0.3).

```
# Final SNP number
92931 variants loaded from subset0.3.bim.
Note: No phenotype data present.
Calculating allele frequencies... done.
--geno: 59164 variants removed due to missing genotype data.
11638 variants removed due to allele frequency threshold(s)
(--maf/--max-maf/--mac/--max-mac).
22129 variants remaining after main filters.
```
### Fst analysis
[Fst.R](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/Fst.R) runs Fst analysis between both different depths and sites of the samples, visualises the results via heatmap and a PCA plot, runs heterozygosity analysis - everything for both datasets (18 and 14 samples). Metadata can be found [here](https://github.com/talimass/Ocullina_Translocation/blob/main/Transcriptomics/Connectivity/pop.csv).
